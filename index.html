<h3> Germany</h3>
<h4> a fine of 132 billion gold marks</h4>
<p> This was a huge sum, to give an example this was valued at 33 billion USD at the time. Accounting for inflation this would be 560,320,331,125.83 USD today. To put this strain on the weak economy from the war meant that the germans had no hope of paying. This is why they borrowed money from the prosperous united states as well as printed their own money creating hyperinflation. To give perspective in 1914 one USD was worth 4.2 marks and in a scant 9 years later 1 USD was worth 4.2 trillion marks. This got worse when in 1929 the wall streat crash happened and the US wanted its money back. This debt compouned and devestated the german economy.   

<h4> demilitarization of the rhineland</h4>
<p> The rhineland was the major industrial producer of germany near the border with France. When germany couldnt pay the fines imposed by the aillied powers meantioned before, the French military colonized this area, taking the industrial output without the permission of the germans. This damaged the already weak german economy. Another factor that contributed in the tensions that led ot WWII is the reported abuse of german workers in the rhineland. There was even a report in the germen news that a french soldier had killed multiple german workers.</p>
<h4> military reduction</h4>

<p> In the Treaty of Versailles the allied powers wanted Germany to decrease its military to just 100 thousand men as opposed to the millions before. They also required that the germans not have an air force. Later this was one of the first rules broken when Hitler set up the luftwaffe.

<h4> Polish Corridor</h4>

<p> the country of Poland wasnt there before the first world war. It was made out of conquered german and russian land. The germans hated poland and especially the corridor because it split the country apart. What was more hurtful at least to the government was that this was east prussia, the country that unifyed germany just about 20 years ago. 

<h3> Italy</h3>
<h4> Treaty of Versailles</h4>  
<p> Although Italy was on the winners side of WWI they didnt get as much as they were promised. They hoped to get 2x the land that they eventully got. This land that they were scammed out of was more valuable as well due to the fact that it was located along the coastline of the Mediterranean and was prime land for trade and other businesses. 
  <h4> Economic damages</h4>
  <p> Due to the war and the cost of it the economy of Italy was better off without the war despite them being on the winning side. The populace of Italy was angry with this outcome and wanted change bringing about a climate ripe for political upheaval.
    <h4> Weak government</h4>
<p> Although Italy was a empire they had a democracy that looked much like our current system with an elected prime minister. The man that held that position was named Giovanni Giolitti and was highly hated and critized for his corruption, violence and winning through means such as bribery and the like. He was prime minister for 5 terms.
  <h3> Unequal treaties</h3>
  <p> to understand the unequal treaties you need to understand something about Japan. They were isolatonist and had blocked out others for 200 years. This ended when the US came and broke that and established the unequal treaties. They couldnt do anything about it though because of the internal strife, the growing factions, and the decaying of the fuedel system. The people were humiliated by the treaties which entailed that the japanese government lost its autonomy in tariffs and its jurisdiction in dealing withother countries meaning on their land the government couldnt have their laws applicable to them. This was a factor in the meiji restoration as many protested these treaties.
<h4> Little Natural Resources</h4>
<p> With the unequal treaties the country of Japan was rapidly industrizing the problem was that they had very little natural resources to fund that industrization.
  <h4> Sino Japanese war</h4>
  <p> The Sino Japanese war was a war between japan and china. Due to the previously meantioned natural resources problem they decided to take some. They conquered korea and then the western powers such as france and england told them to stop and then imposed
